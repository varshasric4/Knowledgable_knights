# Description

The Knight's Tour project is an interactive application designed to solve and visualize the classic Knight's Tour problem using a graphical user interface (GUI). Built with Python's Tkinter library, this project features a comprehensive interface that combines animated GIFs, chessboard visualization, and media playback to create an engaging user experience.

- Interactive Chessboard: Allows users to click on a chessboard to see valid knight moves from the selected position.
- Knight's Tour Solver: Uses a heuristic approach to find and visualize the solution to the Knight's Tour problem, highlighting each move on the board.
- Animated GIF: Displays an animated GIF on the main window, resized to fit different screen sizes.
- Media Integration: Plays background music during the Knight's Tour visualization using the pygame library.
- Welcome and Input Windows: Features a welcoming screen with an introductory image and an input window for specifying board size and starting position.
